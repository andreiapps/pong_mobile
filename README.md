# pong_mobile
The mobile version of my Pong recreation in Unity.

To build the game from source, install Unity Hub and the latest Unity Editor, then download the source code, extract it if you have downloaded it as a zip, and open it using the Unity Editor, then go to File -> Build Settings, select the platform for which you need to build, and click "Build" or "Build and run"
